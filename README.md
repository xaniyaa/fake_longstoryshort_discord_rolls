## fake_longstoryshort_discord_rolls

### What is that!?

This is a little script that simulates LongStoryShort dice rolls in discord. It just send a message with greater or equal roll than you asked for. 

I made this out of curiosity. Please don't cheat in your games :P. 


##### IMPORTANT I'm not too concerned about the code structure (I was doing it as quickly as possible)

### How to run

1. Rename settings_example.py into settings.py and add all your urls here and LSS JSON file.

2. Install python if it is not installed
``` 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

3. Run the code
```
pip install requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
